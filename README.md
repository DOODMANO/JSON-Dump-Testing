# JSON-Dump-Testing
This simple program uses JSON Dumps to export dictionaries into files, and then re-read them

In this case, the dictionary "{'yummy': 150, 'pizza': 750}" is dumped into a file called "dictori.dict."

This can be read with JSON Load, which allows you to take the dictionary back into the program, from the file
